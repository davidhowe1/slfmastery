            <h1>''growing up, i always felt I was not good enough''</h1>

            <p> As the youngest of 4 siblings, the son of a verbally abusive 
                father and an overworked suffering mother, I grew up with 
                extremely low self esteem and weak emotional boundaries. 
                Short and fat, that’s what my dad would call me as a child, 
                and I believed him. I came to beleve that I was small, 
                unimportant, not attractive and not ‘good enough’. I became 
                a people pleaser, avoiding rejection at any cost, and seeing                         my mother struggle left me feeling somewhat responsible for 
                her difficulty and pain.
            </p>

            <h1>''feeling weak and constantly rejected were the best
                things that ever happened to me''
            </h1>
       
            <p>I grew tired of feeling so inadequate. Having my appearance 
                made fun of, being paralysed with lack of confidence around 
                the opposite sex, developing an abusive relationship with food, 
                to being plagued by anxiety and intrusive thoughts filling my 
                mind from wake to sleep, and then developing Inflammatory Bowel 
                Disease (Ulcerative Colitis)… I finally came to realize that 
                these were all self-created experiences, and therefore I had 
                the key to my own freedom and growth.

            <h1>''become comfortable in discomfort''</h1>

            <p>Aged 22 I set out to discover the world. Travelling via backpack and tent, 
                I managed to traverse Eastern and Western Europe for 2 years on no more than 
                the £700 in my pocket. Living on beaches, joining sustainable eco projects, 
                and proving to myself that there was a magic to living life continually 
                outside of the comfort zone. Life was bliss, until a deep sense of emptiness 
                began to shadow my life. I was living my wildest dreams, refusing to settle 
                into a high paid corporate ‘soul-less’ job and old age retirement, yet I lacked 
                life prupose and meaning… 
            </p>

            <p> Aged 25 I hit an all time low in life. Addicted to sugar, marijuana and feeling 
                extremely un-useful to the world, I contemplated suicide, and what it would be 
                like to no longer have my live. ”What’s the point?” I asked, for I simply could 
                not see value in my time and life.
            </p>

            <h1>''your life has purpose when you learn to live for something greater 
                than your own desires''
            </h1>


            <p>I rebelled against such an idea during my early 20’s, however now I can see. 
                In 2019 I began teaching Yoga & Meditation, and was surprised by how well I 
                was able to help others create lasting change in their mental and physical 
                health. People usually find it hard to believe when they experience silence 
                of the mind for the first time. Especially those who had decided they ‘couldn’t 
                meditate’. Many have stated to have their ‘mind blown’ after having experienced 
                inner peace with such ease, my mother couldn’t believe it when I showed her how 
                simple it could be. Yoga revealed my purpose, and that is to teach others how to 
                self-mentor themselves through any mind-body challenge.
